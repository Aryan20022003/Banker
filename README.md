#Banker App

Welcome to the Banker App! I created this web app to simulate a banking environment and provide an easy way to manage transactions.

In building this app, I utilized several JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, array manipulation, Map creation, and manipulation, as well as the implementation of CSS properties. I also made use of functional programming language concepts, such as callback functions and main functions of other data structures.

It's worth noting that the HTML and CSS used in this app were provided by my mentor. I focused on implementing the JavaScript functionality and logic to make the app work.

I've implemented several key features in this app, including user login using a Map, the ability to add new transaction data, fund transfers, and account closure.

To make things easier, I've created some free user accounts that you can use to explore the app. Here are the login details for each account:

Account --> js, Password: 1111
Account --> ss, Password: 4444
Account --> jd, Password: 2222
Account --> stw, Password: 3333
I hope you enjoy using this Banker App and find it a helpful tool for managing your transactions. Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for future updates. Thank you for using Banker App!
